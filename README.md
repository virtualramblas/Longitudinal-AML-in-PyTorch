# Longitudinal-AML-in-PyTorch
Porting of the "Neurosymbolic Learning for Predicting Cell Fate Decisions from Longitudinal Single-Cell Transcriptomics in Paediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia" [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13199) code to PyTorch.  
The official repository of the aforementioned paper is [here](https://github.com/Abicumaran/Longitudinal_AML). While the paper mentions that the Transformer used to  analyze temporal gene expression patterns across three time-points has been implemented in PyTorch, the source code in the companion repo contains a TensorFlow implementation of such model. The code in this repo is about a port of the model to PyTorch. In the original paper implementation, also the LSTM used to analyze temporal dependencies in longitudinal gene expression patterns across three states has been implemented in TensorFlow (in scope for this repo to port it to PyTorch next).
